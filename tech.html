	<h1 style="text-align:center">8 Peronal Favorite Tech Items (from Lazada)</h1>
	
	<div class="content">
	<p>These are some personal tech pieces that are used <b>everyday</b> and usually because they are good enough to great products. So here is a list from good to great, <b>in my opinion.</b>
	<i>Sorry in advance for the quality of the photos.</i>
	</p>
	</div>
	<h2>8) The Razer Mouse Pad</h2>
	<br>
	<center>
	<a href="https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/razer-extra-large-gaming-mouse-pad-70cm-x-30-cm-razer-mousepad-i429522938-s1065952113.html" target="_blank">
	<img align="center" src="mp.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="razer mouse pad"></a>
	<video width="640" height="360" controls>
	<source src="mousepad.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video>
	</center>
	<div class="content-tech"><p> This  mouse pad was nice, <b>a lot of space</b> for your mouse to move and extra space to place your keyboard. The only issue I can think of personally is that it is <i>most likely not a genuine product</i> since
	Razer products are known for a hefty price tag, but this is the only mouse pad that I've purchased and have been using every since
	</p>
	</div>
	<h2>7) Blue Light Filter Glasses</h2>
	<br>
	<center>
	<a href="https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/mfsunnies-clubmaster-computer-anti-radiationblue-light-classic-metal-hinges-high-quality-acetate-frame-011-i224947074-s309458630.html?mp=1" target="_blank">
	<img align="center" src="blueGlasses.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="razer mouse pad"></a>
	<video width="640" height="360" controls>
	<source src="Frames.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video>
	</center>
	<div class="content-tech"><p> These glasses are a bit annoying to wear because they are <i>crooked</i>. <i>A lot of reviews have stated this as well</i>. It may be due to the <b>poor packaging</b>,
	but this is higher on the list because I do care about my eyesight. Since online classes are happening, students will have more <b>time exposed to blue light</b> than before,
	so this should hopefully help with that
	</p>
	</div>
	<h2>6) Haylou Solar Smartwatch</h2>
	<br>
	<center>
	<a href="https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/free-screen-protectors-global-english-version-xiaomi-haylou-ls05-solar-smart-watch-sport-metal-round-case-heart-rate-sleep-monitor-ip68-waterproof-30-day-battery-ios-android-i812106994-s2500038670.html?mp=1" target="_blank">
	<img align="center" src="smartwatch.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="razer mouse pad"></a>
	<video width="640" height="360" controls>
	<source src="watch.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video>
	</center>
	<div class="content-tech"><p> This watch does not look like the price range that it is in. It has <b>a lot of features for the price.</b> The gripe I have with this watch though is that 
	the <i>software is buggy.</i> Haylou is a company that works with Xiaomi, and I have tried their mi bands before. They have better software, but I don't like the frame of the Mi Band line personally. 
	So if somehow they catch up with xiaomi, they would easily be higher on the list

	<h2>5) BESDER Webcam</h2>
	<br>
	<center>
	<a href="https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/besder-webcam-1080p-130-wide-angle-auto-focus-webcam-hd-usb-plug-and-play-desktop-laptops-webcam-buil-in-microphone-i713608116-s2075342878.html?mp=1" target="_blank">
	<img align="center" src="webcam.jpg" width="360" height="640" alt="razer mouse pad"></a>
	<video width="640" height="360" controls>
	<source src="BendCam.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video>
	</center>
	<div class="content-tech"><p> A classmate of mine started streaming and I thought why not try it as well, during the summer. Searching through webcams I came accross this and after a few streams of mine, my friend asked what the webcam model was. 
	To his suprise it wasn't a logitech c920. This also as a viewing angle of <b>130 degrees</b> (according to the page). This webcam is good if you ever need to have a camera in front of you such as online class. 
	</p>
	</div>
	<h2>4) Speaker</h2>
	<br>
	<center>
	<a href="https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/ezeey-s5-portable-usb-35mm-multimedia-speaker-for-desktop-laptop-notebook-tablet-smartphones-pc-speaker-black-i232726566-s314192496.html?mp=1" target="_blank">
	<img align="center" src="speakers.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="razer mouse pad"></a>
	<video width="640" height="360" controls>
	<source src="speaker.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video>
	</center>
	<div class="content-tech"><p> Again, <b>for the price</b> they sound good. I've purchased this not too long ago and I am pleased with the amount of volume this can output. This <i>won't 
	compare</i> with the high end JBL's and Bose speakers, but you could buy multiple of these speakers for one of those. If you're looking for just a speaker on the desk 
	then these shouldn't have a problem
	</p>
	</div>
	<h2>3) Redragon Headset</h2>
	<br>
	<center>
	<a href="https://www.lazada.com.ph/-i105626209-s106262602.html?urlFlag=true&mp=1" target="_blank">
	<img align="center" src="redragon.jpg" width="360" height="640" alt="razer mouse pad"></a>
	<video width="640" height="360" controls>
	<source src="Headset.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video>
	</center>
	<div class="content-tech"><p> This headset was recommended by my cousin and sure enough it doesn't dissappoint. It sacrifices on the <i>quality of the mic</i>, but you have a <b>7.1 Surround sound</b> 
	a <b>volume slider</b>, and a <b>vibration feature.</b> The vibration feature sometimes helps when playing games, because when the sounds comming from the game emit a lot of bass the 
	headset kinda rumbles, thus adding into the <b>emmersion.</b>
	</p>
	</div>
	<h2>2) MiBox S</h2>
	<br>
	<center>
	<a href="https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/xiaomi-mi-tv-box-s-4k-ultra-hd-streaming-media-player-wi-fi-bluetooth-42-chromecast-built-in-quad-core-cpu-set-top-mi-box-w-bluetooth-voice-remote-black-android-tv-box-smart-tv-box-xiaomi-mall-i611400135-s1686992100.html?mp=1 " target="_blank">
	<img align="center" width="640" height="360" src="miBox.jpg" alt="razer mouse pad"></a>
	<video width="640" height="360" controls>
	<source src="miboxs.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video>
	</center>
	<div class="content-tech"><p> I don't have a tv in my room, and I don't want to open the pc just to watch some online video content, because of the power consumption. So this tiny thing has a <b>pack of features</b> such as 
	Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Chrome cast and more. Linus tech tips reviewed this product, and comapred to the competitors, it is <b>competitively priced.</b>
	</p>
	</div>
	<h2>1) Logitech G304</h2>
	<br>

	<div class="content-tech"><p> Around Youtube, recommendations of wireless mice emerged on my feed. Browsing around and they all have one conlusion "go wireless". The reviews claim that wireless mice nowadays are <b>indistinguisable</b> in terms 
	of input lag, compared to <b>wired mice.</b> Seems to good to be true, but looking at experiments done, it seems like the claims may be right. When switching from wired to wireless, <i>it can get pretty pricey.</i> This mouse is <b>one of the cheapest wireless 
	mice you'll find.</b> In my experience, the first time holding the mouse was weird. I didn't feel any restrictions due to there being no wire present, so everytime I'd play games, it felt like the mouse would fall off my desk. And if ever I was lazy I could 
	sit back from a far and just bring my mouse and use my computer from a distance. And sure enough it is indistinguisable to other wired mice.
